OOP is focused on objects and utilizes methods and data to manipulate them. It is useful in modeling real-world entities like people, places and things. Functional programming is based on the concept of functions and uses functions to manipulate data. It is useful in creating programs that are easy to modify and maintain. OOP is more focused on creating software components, while FP is focused on solving specific problems. OOP is procedural and relies heavily on code, while functional programming is declarative and more concise in nature. OOP is more popular than functional programming and is used more for commercial applications and web-based development.',\n",

As temperatures rise, many species are being forced to migrate to new habitats or risk being lost forever. This has caused major disruption to the delicate balance of many ecosystems, resulting in the decline of biodiversity. This decline in biodiversity has far-reaching implications, such as decreased food security, increased pressure on natural resources, and weakened soil fertility. Climate change-induced changes in rainfall patterns have also caused changes in water availability, soil erosion, and floods which have had major impacts on human populations and their livelihoods. Additionally, climate change can also cause ocean acidification, leading to a decrease in marine biodiversity.

The process begins when the plant takes in carbon dioxide from the environment and combines it with water to form glucose molecules using the energy from sunlight. This glucose is then broken down into simpler molecules of carbon dioxide and water. During this process, the energy released is used to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. ATP is used by the plant to power other processes, such as growth and reproduction. Additionally, the ATP can also be broken down further to produce heat energy, which helps to sustain the plant's temperature. The carbon dioxide and water molecules produced in the process are then released back into the environment to complete the cycle.\",\n",

Common steps of data pre-processing include data cleaning, feature engineering, data normalization, and feature selection. Data cleaning involves identifying and addressing any errors, outliers, or missing values. Feature engineering is the process of transforming existing features to create new features that better capture the information contained in the raw data. Data normalization is used to rescale the values of certain features to a standard range which allows for more meaningful comparisons between features. In feature selection, irrelevant and redundant features are removed to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its accuracy.',\n",
